* Notes for learning Angular Material
** Installing Angular Material into an Angular project
   ng add @angular/material
** Ensure that you've imported the proper module into app.module.ts
   To use any components, check the API documentation to see which modules need to be
   imported for which components.
   Make sure to add to the imports array.
** A better option than keeping track of imports as above...
   Create a separate module to only import all of the material design submodules.
   Add the new module (i.e. 'material.module.ts') to the ngModule of your main app.
   This new module should import/export each needed material module.
